My research interests include Shape Optimization, Topology Optimization, Fluid-Structure Interaction and Scientific Machine Learning. With my research, I try to
* use mathematical theory to explain and enhance algorithms to tackle real world applications,
* enhance existing theoretical results to narrow the gap between theory and praxis.
