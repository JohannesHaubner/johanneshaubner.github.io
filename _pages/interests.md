My research interests include Shape Optimization, Topology Optimization, Fluid-Structure Interaction and Scientific Machine Learning. In my research, I use mathematical theory to enhance algorithms to tackle real world applications. Moreover, I enhance existing theoretical results to narrow the gap between theory and praxis.
